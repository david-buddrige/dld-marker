This program is designed to perform tests on a website folder using the
North Metropolitan TAFE html standards, as used for the cluster unit
Digital Layout and Design.  

It then produces a CSV report of any problems that are found in the 
website, including some basic checks on image file sizes, upper and 
lower-case issues, and missing alt properties in <img> tags.
